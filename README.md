Task Details:

Task: 
• Build a RESTful API that manages a collection of webtoons inspired by “Top 14 Castle 
Swimmer Characters You Need to Know”. The API should support the following endpoints: 

o GET /webtoons: Fetch all webtoons with basic details (title, description, characters). 
o POST /webtoons: Add a new webtoon entry, including title, summary, and 
characters. 
o GET /webtoons/ 
: Fetch a specific webtoon by its ID, returning detailed information. 
o DELETE /webtoons/ 
: Remove a webtoon entry by its ID. 

• Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store the webtoon data. Ensure efficient 
querying and indexing for performance optimization. 

• Implement security best practices for your API, such as input validation, rate limiting, and 
JWT-based authentication for the POST and DELETE endpoints.
